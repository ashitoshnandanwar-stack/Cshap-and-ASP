Stateful versus stateless methods
In software development projects, the term state is used to describe the condition of the execution environment at a specific moment in time.
As your code executes line by line, values are stored in variables. At any moment during execution, the current state of the application is the collection of all values stored in memory.
Some methods don't rely on the current state of the application to work properly. 
In other words, stateless methods are implemented so that they can work without referencing or changing any values already stored in memory. Stateless methods are also known as static methods.
Other methods, however, must have access to the state of the application to work properly. 

In other words, stateful methods are built in such a way that they rely on values stored in memory by previous lines of code that have already been executed.
Or they modify the state of the application by updating values or storing new values in memory. They're also known as instance methods.
Stateful (instance) methods keep track of their state in fields, which are variables defined on the class. Each new instance of the class gets its own copy of those fields in which to store state.

To call methods of a class in the .NET Class Library, you use the format ClassName.MethodName(), where the . symbol is the member access operator to access a method defined on the class, and the () symbols are the method invocation operators.
When calling a stateless method, you don't need to create a new instance of its class first.
When calling a stateful method, you need to create an instance of the class, and access the method on the object.
Use the new operator to create a new instance of a class.
An instance of a class is called as an object.

# Array
An array is a special type of variable that can hold multiple values of the same data type.
To declare the array and initialize values in a single statement, enter the following code:
c#
string[] fraudulentOrderIDs = [ "A123", "B456", "C789" ];
This example uses the Collection expression syntax, which was introduced in C# 12 and is supported in .NET 10.
You may also see an older syntax used to initialize an array.
C#
string[] fraudulentOrderIDs = { "A123", "B456", "C789" };
Notice that this older syntax uses curly braces {} to enclose the values of the array. Both syntaxes are valid.

int value = (int)1.5m; // casting truncates
Console.WriteLine(value);

int value2 = Convert.ToInt32(1.5m); // converting rounds up
Console.WriteLine(value2);

string[] values = { "12.3", "45", "ABC", "11", "DEF" };

decimal total = 0m;
string message = "";

foreach (var value in values)
{
    decimal number; // stores the TryParse "out" value
    if (decimal.TryParse(value, out number))
    {
        total += number;
    } else
    {
        message += value;
    }
}

Console.WriteLine($"Message: {message}");
Console.WriteLine($"Total: {total}");
