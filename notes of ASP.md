# REST API means Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface.
In simple words, a REST API is a way for two applications to communicate with each other over the internet using HTTP.
Why REST API is used
To connect frontend (React, Angular, Mobile app) with backend (Java, Spring Boot, ASP.NET, Node.js)
To send and receive data (mostly in JSON format)
To make applications scalable, fast, and independent

What is ASP.NET MVC Core?
ASP.NET MVC Core is a web framework by Microsoft used to build:
Web applications
Websites
REST APIs

It follows the MVC design pattern:
M – Model → Data & business logic
V – View → UI (HTML pages)
C – Controller → Handles request & response

| Folder      | Purpose          |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| Controllers | Handles requests |
| Models      | Data classes     |
| Views       | UI pages         |
| wwwroot     | CSS, JS, images  |
| Program.cs  | App start point  |

2️⃣ MVC Components (Simple Meaning)

🔹 Model
Represents data
Contains business logic
Communicates with database
📌 Example: Student, Employee

🔹 View
Represents UI
Contains HTML + Razor
Displays data to user
📌 Example: Index.cshtml

🔹 Controller
Acts as middleman
Receives request
Calls Model
returns View
📌 Example: HomeController

Browser
   ↓  (URL Request)
Routing Engine
   ↓
Controller
   ↓
Action Method
   ↓
Model (optional)
   ↓
View
   ↓
Browser (HTML Response)

Role of Routing (Important)
Routing maps:
URL → Controller → Action
Default route in Program.cs:
pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}"
Meaning:
Controller default = Home
Action default = Index
id = optional

Q4. What connects URL to Controller?
✔ Routing Engine

| File/Folder      | Purpose         |

| wwwroot          | Static files(css,js,
                     image,bootstrap)|
| Program.cs       | App startup     |
| appsettings.json | Config          |
